The pynisher is a little module intended to be used to limit a functions resources.
It starts a new process, sets the desired limits for it and executes the function inside it.
In the end, it returns the function return value. If, for any reason, the function call is not
successful, None is returned.

Currently, the total memory usage(*), the wall clock time, the cpu time and the number of processes can be limited.


(*) As the subprocess also includes the Python interpreter, the actual memory available to your function might be less than the specified value.
